üîÅ INPUT DOCUMENTS

üìä INCOME RULES
‚Ä¢	Rental Income:
o	Use the current rents from the rent roll.
o	If there are vacant units, calculate their income using the average rent of that unit type (not market rent).
o	Include a rent analysis tab:
ÔÇß	Average rent per unit type
ÔÇß	Rent per square foot (PSF)
ÔÇß	Flag units that are significantly underpriced (30%+ under average)
o	If square footage is missing, ask user to input SF by unit type.
‚Ä¢	Other Income:
o	Use the actual trailing 12-month total.
o	If missing, flag and prompt for clarification.
‚Ä¢	Occupancy Trending:
o	If T3, T2, or T4 income is higher than the T12 and trending upward, use that.
o	Never use shorter periods if the income dipped and then spiked ‚Äî only use when there‚Äôs a consistent uptrend.

________________________________________
üîç DEEP LOGIC / DECISION-MAKING
‚Ä¢	If T12 is inconsistent, prefer trailing 2‚Äì6 months if trending upward.
‚Ä¢	If income is erratic, do not switch to T3 just because the last month looked good.
‚Ä¢	Flag missing or irregular data:
o	If square footage is missing, ask.
o	If rent roll lacks pricing, ask.
o	If income statement includes ‚Äúother‚Äù categories after NOI, cut them out.
‚Ä¢	Highlight CapEx and other one-time expenses (e.g., flooring, appliances, major plumbing) and move to Notes.
‚Ä¢	If given multiple files, the system should choose the best one and ignore duplicates or bloated tabs.
